** Installation
   #+begin_src shell-script
     make install
   #+end_src

** Shell integration
   - sh
     #+begin_src shell-script
       fmz() {
           tmp=$(mktemp)
           command fmz --cd "$tmp" "$@"
           res=$(tail -n 1 "$tmp")
           if [ -d "$res" ] && [ "$res" != "$PWD" ]; then
               echo cd "$res"
               cd "$res" || return 1
           fi
           rm "$tmp"
       }
     #+end_src

   - fish
     #+begin_src shell-script
       function fmz
           set tmp (mktemp)
           command fmz --cd $tmp $argv
           set res (tail -n 1 $tmp)
           if test -d "$res" && test "$res" != "$PWD"
               echo cd $res
               cd $res || return 1
           end
           rm $tmp
       end
     #+end_src

** Default bindings
   In general, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]-like bindings where used, M-x for menu, and F1 to show all bindings.

** Configuration
   Config file is just a shell script that gets sourced in fmz. So be sure not to have the setuid bit set on fmz.
   Key symbols are as defined by fzf (check ~man fzf~).
   You can bind fzf actions, functions (using ~fun~), or quick functions that does not need ~f~ and ~fx~ (using ~funq~).
   Example config file (~/.config/fmzrc.sh):

   #+begin_src shell-script
     # basic bindings
     bind alt-w  fun  copy
     bind ctrl-w fun  move
     bind ctrl-y funq paste
     bind ctrl-c      abort

     # add a function to menu and bind it
     add_fun myless 'Less a file'
     bind ctrl-p fun myless
     myless() {
         tput rmcup
         less "$f"
     }

     # bookmarks
     bookmark ~/Documents
     bookmark ~/Pictures
     bookmark ~/Videos

     # other variables
     OPENER=xdg-open
     TERMINAL=st
   #+end_src

** Mount monitor
   #+begin_src shell-script
     fmz --mount-monitor
   #+end_src

   If ~dunstify~ exists, the notification action will mount the drive and open fmz in a terminal window.
   ~notify-send~ can be used instead but clicking won't do anything.
   The default bind for unmounting the current directory is ctrl-u.

** Why?
   I tried many other file managers like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander][mc]], [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][ranger]], [[https://github.com/gokcehan/lf][lf]], [[https://github.com/jarun/nnn][nnn]], [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff][fff]], and several others that I forgot.
   From the GUI world, it worth mentioning nautilus, nemo, thunar, and pantheon's files.
   They all are cool in some way, but still not as good as I wanted.
   If you're here, probably there's no need to talk about GUI.
   Out of all the terminal file managers, lf has been my choice for a pretty long time and I do believe that it is the best out of the ones I just mentioned.
   However, with time, I started realizing lf problems. Here are some of what I recall:
   - A bit of unnecessary bloat.
     lf is relatively so minimal. But, in my opinion, there are some unnecessary parts like the builtin copy implementation and the config parser.
   - Too much configuration
     lf is almost unusable out of the box. Minimalism is good of course, but having some sane defaults can be done without being bloated too.
   - I use fzf anyway...
     Even inside lf, I used to have a key binding to fzf to find and jump to wherever I want. In practice, I found myself opening fzf almost every time I use lf.
   I'm not trying to say lf is bad. It is amazing. It just wasn't enough for me.

** Annoying selection
   If the pointer and selection get reset after every operation, this is due to fzf not supporting this feature (as of now). There's a discussion in a [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/pull/2440][pull request]] regarding this. Feel free to join and/or try my branch.
